# 3D-Print-to-Metal-Cast
I wanted to test using a 3D printed model as a mold for metal casting. Included here are photos along the project, and a final version of the stl file I used to print the design from. The design is my own variation of the New Zealand mythical creature, Manaia, that is prevalent in the Maori tradition - A creature that is often combined of several different animal types or even humanoid forms. My own design was further inspired by a leafy sea dragon.

Description of images:
M01 - Original sketch
M02 - First model I completed in Sculptris. I first made the basic S-shape of the body in Fusion 360 and imported it to Sculptris, the same with the two spirals. The scales and fins I made as separate objects in Sculptris that I then combined to the main file.
M03 - First test print. Took about 4 hours.
M04 - Complete print. Approximately 12 cm across from top to bottom.
M05 - First test in casting sand. A few of the details were not successful, so I set to making a new model.
M06 - The finished new model in Sculptris. I made the spirals in Sculptris this time, and made them a little more hefty. Also made the fins follow the body shape in a smoother way.
M07 - View in Cura before printing.
M08 - For the second test I also printed out the more difficult parts of the model to do a partial test with casting sand, instead of printing out the complete model at first. Success!
M09 - All the printed 3D stuff I did for the project. The right one is the finished proper model.
M10 - Ready to be set in the sand and cast.
M11 - Half done.
M12 - Adding screws to help remove the mold from the sand.
M13 - The cast. Not a success. The metal didn't properly fill the space and I was left with half a manaia.
I will redo this test next year when I get back to school and will post photos if/when I get a successful cast done.
